# Glossary

## Module
A discrete unit of data collection and display. A data interface concept. A package inside the app.

Examples: [New Relic](/modules/newrelic), [Git](/modules/git), [Weather](/modules/weather_services/weather).

## Widget
The onscreen representation of a Module. The widget is responsible for
being the interface between the app and the data collection.

Widgets are defined by a required `widget.go` file in a Module.

## WTF
An acronym for "What The Fsck?", as in "What the fsck are all these browser tabs open for?" and "What the fsck am I doing today?"

(And if you're not a fan of that, then it stands for "What are The Facts?", or "Whiskey Tango Foxtrot", or "Where to, Frodo?". It's up to you.)
