# Installation

## Homebrew

The easiest way to install from Homebrew is of course

```bash
❯ brew install wtfutil
```

Or, to stay up-to-date with the very latest release at all times, tap the cask that is 
generated on each new release:

```bash
❯ brew tap wtfutil/wtfutil
❯ brew install wtfutil

❯ wtfutil
```

## As a Binary

Grab the latest version from the <a href="https://github.com/wtfutil/wtf/releases">Releases page</a>.

Expand it, and `cd` into the resulting directory. Then run:

```bash
❯ ./wtfutil
```

and that should also do it.

## From Source

Download the source code repo and install the dependencies:

```bash
# Set the Go proxy variable to GoCenter
❯ export GOPROXY="https://gocenter.io"

# Enable Go modules
❯ export GO111MODULE=on

❯ go get -u github.com/wtfutil/wtf
❯ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/wtfutil/wtf
❯ make install
❯ make run
```

and that should do it.
