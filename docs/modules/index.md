# Modules

![screenshot](/assets/screenshot.png)

A module is a discrete unit of
functionality that extracts data from a source and packages that data
for display.

For example, the [New Relic](/modules/newrelic) module
uses New Relic's API to retrieve a list of the latest deploys and
packages that information as a list for display in the "New Relic"
widget.

The [Clocks](/modules/clocks) module takes a list of
timezones and packages that information as a list of city/time pairs for
display in the "Clocks" widget.
