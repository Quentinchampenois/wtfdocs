## Homebrew

{{< code lang="bash" >}}
❯ brew uninstall wtfutil
{{< /code >}}

## Remove the Binary and Configuration

WTF ships as a single binary named `wtfutil`. Assuming you have installed the binary, run:

{{< code lang="bash" >}}
❯ rm $(which wtfutil)
{{< /code >}}

If you have configured WTF, you will also want to delete your configs:

{{< code lang="bash" >}}
❯ rm ~/.config/wtf
{{< /code >}}

and that should also do it.
